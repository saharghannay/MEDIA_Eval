# Neural Networks approaches focused on French Spoken Language Understanding: application to the MEDIA Evaluation Task
This is the official repository for the paper, published at [COLING'2020](https://coling2020.org/).  
The project contains all the code an data needed to run the experiments. 
The code used in those experiments  is basically based on ["NeuroNLP2"](https://github.com/XuezheMax/NeuroNLP2/tree/pytorch0.4) tool and on the hugging face [example](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/master/examples/ner/run_ner.py) adapted for Spoken Language Understanding task on [MEDIA](https://catalog.elra.info/en-us/repository/browse/ELRA-S0272/) data. 


##Organisation
This repository is composed of:
- Data: contains all the data and the different configurations used in the experiments 
- Embeddings: contains all the embeddings vectors trained on different data: media, wiki and wiki+media
- NeuroNLP2: NeuroNLP2 tool adapated for MEDIA task
- BERT: hugging face example adapated for MEDIA task

##Installation
Please follow the installation instruction mentionned in the README file for both tools "NeuroNLP2" and "BERT".
